We already had to have a repairman come fix something on it. The repairman just left an hour ago and has to order a part that will take 7-10 days. When it's on the spin cycle it makes a noise like it's unbalanced, even after moving clothes around several times in the washtub. We even took the clothes completely out and it still made that unbalanced noise on spin cycle. According to the repairman, this is a common problem with these machines. I think the part he said needed replaced was the stabilizer After paying that much money for a washer, it should run for more than 4 months, before needing repairs. We also bought the matching dryer.

It is recommended to use the Tide\u00AE Washing Machine Cleaner once a month to clean and freshen your top load washer. Being an oxygenated formula, it will help to remove odor-causing residues which build up on the surfaces in your washer over time, even in the areas you can't see. It is available for purchase in the detergent aisle at your local grocery stores.\n\nTo determine if you are, in fact, using too much determine, take a wash cloth which was recently washed. Place it in a bowl of cold water and move it back and forth. If the water comes cloudy or soapy, this is an indication to cut back on the amount of detergent based on your water type and hardness.\n\nAdditional information can also be accessed at:\nhttp://www.geappliances.com/search/google/infobase/10000995.htm\nhttp://www.geappliances.com/search/google/infobase/10003597.htm\n\nThank you for taking the time to contact us to help resolve.","UserNickname":"JULIEatGE","Photos":[],"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"BadgesOrder":[],"TotalInappropriateFeedbackCount":0,"AdditionalFields":{},"Videos":[],"ContextDataValues":{},"Badges":{},"ContextDataValuesOrder":[],"IsSyndicated":false,"UserLocation":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[]},"459105":{"Id":"459105","CID":"d4eb1972-f064-505c-b790-57100cddaa70","SourceClient":"ge_appliances","LastModificationTime":"2014-10-06T19:30:26.000+00:00","LastModeratedTime":"2014-10-06T19:30:26.000+00:00","QuestionId":"377551","CampaignId":"BV_QA_PORTAL_ANSWER_MANAGEMENT","AuthorId":"AMT_sbrandon_geappliances","UserLocation":"sue.brandon@ge.com","ContentLocale":"en_US","IsFeatured":false,"IsBrandAnswer":false,"TotalFeedbackCount":1,"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":1,"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","SubmissionId":"mdl9oowj7mf8ue5maz7vez9se","SubmissionTime":"2014-10-06T19:17:02.000+00:00","AnswerText":"Hi Lyns13-this is Sue from GE.

Thanks for your purchase! We are happy to help. This is unusual as this model features wash action waterfall. Loads receive thorough coverage with this waterfall that combines with a recirculation pump that continually moves the water and detergent through the wash load. Loosely and evenly add items around the outside of the basket. Overloading may negatively impact wash performance. See page 11 of the owner's manual for suggested loading examples at the following link:\nhttp://products.geappliances.com/MarketingObjectRetrieval/Dispatcher?RequestType=PDF&Name=49-90489-1.pdf\n\nThis is a high efficiency washing machine with Infusor\u2122 wash action. This system requires less water while providing effective cleaning action. You may notice that the water level is lower than on your previous washer. This is normal for an Infusor\u2122-equipped washer.\n\nChoose the Fabric Softener option for a deeper fill rinse even if fabric softener is not used.\n\nTo view a tip sheet and diagram of the Infusor:\nhttp://products.geappliances.com/MarketingObjectRetrieval/Dispatcher?RequestType=PDF&Name=175D6444P001_US (2).pdf\n\nTo view how the Infusor works:\nhttp://bcove.me/m5jeswt6\n\nWe encourage
