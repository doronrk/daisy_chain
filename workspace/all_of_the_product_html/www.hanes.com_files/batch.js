know not all bras are consistent with band &/or cup sizes. I'm a 38D typically & in some Hanes bras I need a bit bigger in the band/cup and some I need smaller in the band. I've tried other Hanes wirefree bras. I've ordered XL. I am now ordering larges as the bands were a bit big (when you 1st wear a bra you should be able to use the largest hooks. That way when the bra stretches out in time you can make it smaller). However, the band in this bra was super huge. I'm not even sure if a large will cover it. I'd probably need a medium for the band to fit right but then I'm sure my breasts wouldn't fit correctly. I wish Hanes would fix this as I love the french blue color!
