Additionally, out-of-stock, personalized and customized products can take longer to process, but will still be shipped to your address within 2 days from the time the product leaves the warehouse. In most cases, the store will publish shipping policies for these items.</p><p>Please use this chart as a general guideline to estimate your order arrival time, which we and our retailers strive to meet with every order.
